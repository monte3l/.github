# Repository blueprint

The GitHub-side settings a new `monte3l` repository should have, as data plus
one script that compares a repository with it and can bring it in line.

A template repository cannot carry these: GitHub copies files and branches
only, not rulesets, Actions policy, security features, labels or merge
settings. The reasoning and the full checklist are in
[`docs/github-blueprint.md`](https://github.com/monte3l/m3l-groundwork/blob/main/docs/github-blueprint.md)
in `m3l-groundwork`.

## Files

| File                     | What it holds                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rulesets/main-branch.json` | The `main` ruleset, taken from `m3l-groundwork`: signed commits, no force-push or delete, PRs with resolved threads, and `verify`, `Dependency Review` and `CodeQL` required |
| `rulesets/tags.json`     | Tags cannot be moved or deleted; creating one stays allowed so releases can tag                            |
| `repo-settings.json`     | Merge settings: merge commit and squash allowed, rebase off, delete head branches after merge             |
| `actions.json`           | Read-only workflow token, workflows cannot approve PRs, approve fork PR runs for all outside contributors, SHA pinning required |
| `labels.json`            | Labels that Dependabot and the baseline's scheduled audit apply                                            |
| `environments.example.json` | An example `npm-publish` environment. Not applied by the script: it needs real reviewer ids            |

`integration_id` values in the `main` ruleset are GitHub's own apps (15368 is
GitHub Actions, 57789 is code scanning), so they are the same in every
organization.

## Use

```sh
bin/apply-repo-baseline.sh monte3l/NEW-REPO             # read-only comparison, exit 1 on drift
bin/apply-repo-baseline.sh monte3l/NEW-REPO --dry-run   # also shows what --apply would run
bin/apply-repo-baseline.sh monte3l/NEW-REPO --apply     # changes the repository
```

It needs `gh` authenticated with admin rights on the repository, and `jq`.
Each item is compared with the live state first, so running `--apply` twice
changes nothing the second time. Existing labels are never rewritten.

> [!WARNING]
> The blueprint requires the `verify`, `Dependency Review` and `CodeQL`
> checks and SHA-pinned actions. Applying it to a repository that does not
> produce those checks, or that uses unpinned actions, blocks merges and
> fails workflows until that is fixed. Run `--check` first.

## Not covered

Secrets, GitHub App installations, code scanning default setup, and
organization policy (default repository permission, secret visibility,
allowed actions). Those need an organization owner. See the checklist linked
above.
